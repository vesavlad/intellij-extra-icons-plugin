## Known issues

* Python icon (`.py` files) can't be customized in PyCharm Community and Professional: it seems to be a limitation of this IDE. Issue not reproduced in IntelliJ IDEA.
* 2021 IDEs may not support a limited set of features provided by Extra Icons, like Angular and Helm support. I have no satisfying solution for those IDEs, but everything works fine in IJ 2022. I keep the compatibility with old IDEs because it generates no errors, and most features are still supported. I will update the minimum IDE version only if newer IDE APIs introduce breaking changes (in other words, if I have no choice).
